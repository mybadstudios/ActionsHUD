Quick start instructions for the ActionsHUD
==========================================

If you are eager to get started with this system but don't know where to begin, here is
a quick overview of how to get started...

Step 1. Create a UGUI Canvas in your scene if you don't already have one. 
Step 2. Drag ActionsHUDCompleteSample onto the canvas
Step 3. Drop a ActionsHUDObjectOfInterest prefab on every object in your scene that you want to interact with.
        Make sure to complete the Actions field in the Inspector by setting a value of at least 1 and
        picking a value from the drop down list
Step 4. Drop the ActionsHUDPlayerObject prefab on your player character
Step 5. The objects you can interact with will each receive one or more of the following 4 messages depending
        on what you specified for that object in step 3: Inspect, InteractWith, StartDialogue and Collect
        You need to create one or more scripts to place on the objects you picked in step 3 so that they have
        one (and only one) function that corresponds to the actions you chose for it.
        
And that is all there is to it. Step 5 might sound like a bit of a bummer but have a look at the demo scene
and you will see that some objects can easily share the same script while others that have more specific
behavior can have their own, custom scripts. 

There you have it... the 5 steps to using the ActionsHUD.
